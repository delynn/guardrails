  # Coding-agent hooks (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI): drift
  # the agent introduces is reported back to it while it works, and it
  # isn't allowed to end its turn with new errors. Adapters translate
  # each agent's hook input and output; the checks here don't know
  # which agent is asking.
  #
  #   - edit: after the agent edits files, the drift it introduced in
  #     them, as context for its next step
  #   - stop: when it tries to finish, new errors in any template
  #     changed since HEAD send it back to work, once
  #   - session_start: context for a new session, from contributors
  #
  # Other gems contribute to the same events with `Hooks.register`
  # (ui_guardrails-browser adds visual-review rejections). A gem ships
  # its contributor at `lib/guardrails/hook_contributors/<name>.rb`,
  # which the runner loads, so hooks work without booting the app.
